Branches in GitHub allow developers to work on separate lines of development within the same repository. They are important because they:

- Enable Parallel Development: Multiple features or fixes can be developed simultaneously without interfering with each other.
- Isolate Changes: Changes can be made in a branch and tested without affecting the main codebase.
- Facilitate Code Review: Each branch can be reviewed and tested separately before merging.

Describe the process of creating a branch, making changes, and merging it back into the main branch.

1. Create a Branch:
   - Go to your repository on GitHub.
   - Click on the "Branch" dropdown menu and enter a new branch name.
   - Click "Create branch".

2. Make Changes:
   - Checkout the new branch locally using `git checkout branch-name`.
   - Make and commit changes using `git add .` and `git commit -m "message"`.

3. Push Changes:
   - Push the changes to GitHub using `git push origin branch-name`.

4. Merge Branch:
   - Open a pull request from the branch on GitHub.
   - Review the changes and discuss them with team members.
   - Once approved, merge the branch into the main branch using the **"Merge pull request"** button.

Pull Requests and Code Reviews

What is a pull request in GitHub, and how does it facilitate code reviews and collaboration?

A pull request (PR) is a request to merge changes from one branch into another. It facilitates code reviews and collaboration by:

- Reviewing Code: Allows team members to review changes, comment on specific lines, and suggest improvements.
- Discussing Changes: Provides a space for discussing the implementation and impact of the changes.
- Ensuring Quality: Ensures that code is reviewed and tested before being merged into the main branch.

1. Create a Pull Request:
   - Push your branch to GitHub.
   - Go to the "Pull Requests" tab in your repository.
   - Click "New pull request" and select the branch you want to merge.
   - Add a title, description, and any relevant information.
   - Click "Create pull request".

2. Review a Pull Request:
   - Navigate to the pull request on GitHub.
   - Review the changes and comments.
   - Provide feedback, approve, or request changes.
   - Once reviewed, merge the pull request if approved.

GitHub Actions

Explain what GitHub Actions are and how they can be used to automate workflows.

GitHub Actions is a CI/CD and automation tool integrated into GitHub that allows you to define workflows for your projects. It uses YAML files to specify tasks and triggers.

Example of a simple CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions:

1. Create a `.github/workflows` directory in your repository.
2. Add a workflow YAML file (e.g., `ci.yml`):

   ```yaml
   name: CI

   on:
     push:
       branches:
         - main

   jobs:
     build:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest

       steps:
         - name: Checkout code
           uses: actions/checkout@v2

         - name: Set up Node.js
           uses: actions/setup-node@v2
           with:
             node-version: '14'

         - name: Install dependencies
           run: npm install

         - name: Run tests
           run: npm test
   ```

   This pipeline triggers on pushes to the `main` branch, sets up Node.js, installs dependencies, and runs tests.
